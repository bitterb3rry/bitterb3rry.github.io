                This image is of a salad I made that I’m really proud of. The base is a spring mix. For toppings we have edamame, diced persian cucumbers, halved cherry tomatoes, and half an avocado sliced. It was served in a ceramic bowl made and gifted by a coworker during my summer internship. Most importantly, the salad was delicious.
                <br><br>
                I wanted to showcase some foods that I cooked in my project and of course this was one of them (even though it was a simple salad). I think my collection shows that I like to cook and experiment with food. It’s a hobby that always has a tasty product regardless of the process and outcome. Even though my cooking doesn’t always turn out the way I imagined but when it does, it’s pretty good if I do say so myself.

                This image is showing a dog posing on top of a pile of snow, having lots of fun on a nice snowy winter's day with her humans. Based on the background, it looks like they are in a snow-covered park in a city that snows during winter. The pose of the dog is very normal and she seems a little confused. Nonetheless, she’s definitely what they’re looking for in the dog modeling industry the way she’s sporting her (out)fit.
                <br><br>
                Question: did the dog jump up there or did her human put her up there? 
                Answer: I guess we will never know. 
                <br><br>
                Most obvious aspect of this image: there’s a really cute dog on a snow pile shaped like a bunny!
                Most mysterious aspect of this image: who’s that leg and arm belong to?

                A picture is worth a thousand words but a picture can also be interrupted in a thousand ways. Good photography should have subjects that keep the attention of the audience and make them ask questions and start conversations, like the ones used on this <a href="https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">New York Times</a> learning blog.

                I found that <a href="https://themessagetoukraine.obys.agency/">The Message to Ukraine</a>has an interesting use case of images on the web. The images are made into cutouts instead of just displaying them as is.

                For me, modals have become something that is easy for me neglect and exit out. It uses shows up for me on shopping website to offer 10% off coupons for providing an email or to prevent me from keep using the site until I login. It has a bad impression attached to it and it's all the more reasons why it is important to make sure modals are able to capture and maintain the attention of the visitor. By having good layout, good anatomy, and clear buttons, a modal can appear to be less annoying and more legit instead of one that may be asking for an email. One best practice I really agree with from <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">the article</a> is #6. By having the modal being user activated, users aren't inturrpted from what they're doing, for example, they are on a time crunch and need to browse the page really fast. However, I can see how pop-up modals are used to catch attention of the user.

                Forms may feel easy to create when you know what information you want and how you want it but the hidden details are the things that make the most difference in how well the form is being used. My main takeaway from the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">best practices article</a> is that making it easy for the user is the best practice. Nothing visually distracting but keeping it so that they don’t need to guess. Subtle cues for actions and nothing that take more clicks than necessary. Assume the most general ideas when it comes to technical things - don’t design thinking just of one screen size or device. We can’t always assume the user’s mobile abilities either so make sure things work both when clicking and using keys like tabs.

                I think an online form that exemplifies best practices is the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=San+Jose%2C+CA&ns=1">Yelp</a> webpage filter form. The visual aids are apparent for users yet tabbing and using the spacebar to select a checkbox works very well.
