                For me, modals have become something that is easy for me neglect and exit out. It uses shows up for me on shopping website to offer 10% off coupons for providing an email or to prevent me from keep using the site until I login. It has a bad impression attached to it and it's all the more reasons why it is important to make sure modals are able to capture and maintain the attention of the visitor. By having good layout, good anatomy, and clear buttons, a modal can appear to be less annoying and more legit instead of one that may be asking for an email. One best practice I really agree with from <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">the article</a> is #6. By having the modal being user activated, users aren't inturrpted from what they're doing, for example, they are on a time crunch and need to browse the page really fast. However, I can see how pop-up modals are used to catch attention of the user.

                Forms may feel easy to create when you know what information you want and how you want it but the hidden details are the things that make the most difference in how well the form is being used. My main takeaway from the <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">best practices article</a> is that making it easy for the user is the best practice. Nothing visually distracting but keeping it so that they don’t need to guess. Subtle cues for actions and nothing that take more clicks than necessary. Assume the most general ideas when it comes to technical things - don’t design thinking just of one screen size or device. We can’t always assume the user’s mobile abilities either so make sure things work both when clicking and using keys like tabs.

                I think an online form that exemplifies best practices is the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=San+Jose%2C+CA&ns=1">Yelp</a> webpage filter form. The visual aids are apparent for users yet tabbing and using the spacebar to select a checkbox works very well.
