        <h1>comparison project 1: <a href="https://gucciburst.gucci.com/">Gucci Burst</a></h1>
        <p>
            Gucci Burst is a game where you are a show try to dodge items coming in your way. I really enjoyed the 2D animations of Gucci Burst that made the game feel 3D. The colors are bold and the shapes are very gives it a very retro theme. The website does a good job at having a loading screen to make sure users know what's going on. What can be improved is the game instructions because it was hard to follow and the user actions because it's really hard to control the shoe.

        <h1>comparison project 2: <a href="https://canals-amsterdam.nl/">Canals Amsterdam</a></h1>
        <p>
            Canals Amsterdam is a horizontal scrolling website with pictures and words about the canals of Amsterdam. It feels like a magazine with a collage style. The shapes are very basic and it sticks to a color palette that fits the topic. The big typefaces feels like it acts more of an aesthetic than for the reader.

        <h1>project goals</h1>
        <p>
            My goal is of reiterating is to include a scrolling feature on the project and allowing each photo to have its own space. It will feel like a photo album sunsets and the paragraph description will have some educational information about clouds and sunsets, for eaxmple, why are cloud sometimes pink? I want to take inspiration from Canals Amsterdam's layout and Gucci Burst's animations.

        <h1>design strategies</h1>
        <p>
            The design will be minimalistic and heavy focused on the possible animations of the text. I already had some descriptions I wrote for each of the pictures on the site but I would like to display them more. There will need to be a balance between text and images and making sure the text does not take away spotlight from the images. The text will be big and there will be lines that highlight the prominent colors from the picture.

        <h1>interaction strategies</h1>
        <p>
            The main interaction feature will a horizonal scrolling through the images. Along the route, there will be hover interactions for pictures which were also suggests from the feedback sessions from my peers and the teaching team. I want to try to make micro interaction where shapes are triggered to come in and out of the screen based on the scrolling.

        <h1>experience goals</h1>
        <p>
            I want my audience to feel like they are transporting through a magical portal to see these images. I would like to experiment with adding an audio compenet where the user could choose between a couple of chill/relaxing music for an immersive experience.
