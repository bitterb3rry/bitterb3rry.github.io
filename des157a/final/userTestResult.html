            <div>
                <h2>Hover over picture</h2>
                <p>
                    All my participants did not notice the hover function until later. One mentioned that it was actually sort of confusing when they were scrolling that the picture turned clear then blurry which led them to realize that the blurriness was on purpose. I don’t think it is too much of a pain point to address since the page is meant to be interactive and encourage play.
                    Observation 2: Had to scroll all the way to get back to front.

            <h1>Observation 2</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Scrolling back to beginning</h2>
                <p>
                    When I was making the site, I did not realize that the flow was interrupted by the end of the scroll because the participants had to manually scroll all the way back to the front. To improve the flow, I think it’s best to have a button that will scroll the page back to the front when clicked.

            <h1>Observation 3</h1>
            <div>
                <h2>Desktop/Mouse v.s. Laptop/Trackpad Scrolling</h2>
                <p>
                    2 of the participants were on a desktop computer using a mouse while 1 was on a laptop using a trackpad. I have been coding and testing using only a trackpad so the desktop and mouse showed me that scrolling is less smooth on the desktop because of the mouse. The solution suggested by a participant on the desktop was to implement a smooth scroll and I agree it would make the desktop experience better.

            Overall, the participants liked the feel of the website (colors, layouts, type) and the content it provided. One mentioned that he felt it was soothing which was a feeling I was hoping the website would evoke. Some suggestions I got was to give some space around the images, add time/date of the images, a progress bar and. I did quickly and found that it helped frame the images better. I’ve already had the idea of a progress bar but I was not able to figure it out quite yet but will continue to work on it.
