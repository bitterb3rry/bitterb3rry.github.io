        <h3>Confusing Input form</h3>
        <p>
            The input for adding a card was vague to some of the participants. One thought out loud saying “wait, I don’t know what emotions to put here. Is it about a topic or just how I feel right now?”.
        </p>
        <h3>Lack of Cohesion Between Pages</h3>
        <p>
            All the current pages of the site lack cohesion because of sudden change in style and color. Some parts are modern while others look traditional. The idea of these two styles could work together but it’s not working together on this project yet.
        </p>
        <h3>An Informative Opening Page</h3>
        <p>
            I made sure to ask about this because I knew that my project may not be understandable without some information and all participants seem to have gotten out of it that the project is something about emotion. However, one did mention that I should also include stories of the origin.
        </p>
        <h3>Successful Display of Others’ Entries</h3>
        <p>
            All 3 of my participants enjoyed reading others' notes and even found them relatable which matches exactly with how I expected a user would feel as I imagined it from early development storyboarding.

    <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
            In the final version of this project, I will focus on improving upon the input form, refining the opening page to give more back story, and better styling for cohesion. Since the input form is one of the biggest parts of the project that users will be using and I want users to want to participate, it has to be easy to understand and complete. The opening page is important to storytell where and why this project came about to set a good first impression before the user even sees the main part. Styling will be pulling the whole project together along with storytelling, allowing the user to be more immersed in the space I am trying to create.
