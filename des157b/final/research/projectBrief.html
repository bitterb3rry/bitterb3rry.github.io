        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is for people to share their emotions in using 5 main senses of taste into a collective memory display. By sharing people sharing experiences with each other, I want to let people who may be going through emotions feel validated for how they feel and know that they’re not the only ones that’s ever felt that way.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
        <p>I plan to have Chinese design elements because that is where the background idea came from so I wanted to represent that either through patterns, art styles, or typography. Colors will mainly be a muted calm palette with grays, reds, and beiges with pops of color when needed. I will find a type for the alphabet that will give off the same look that Chinese characters usually give.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
        <p>Interactions will focus on inputs from the user and visuals for displaying the inputs. My goal is to have the overall page be free flowing where users can explore on their own within the collective.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>
        <p>The experience I want users to have is being able to learn a little about how Chinese phrases connect emotions to taste and background information then being able to contribute to the collective. From reading other people’s inputs, I hope users will be able to become more comfortable with their own feelings and allow themselves to be ok with them.</p>
