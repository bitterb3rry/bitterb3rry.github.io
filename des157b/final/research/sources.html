            Main focus of this research from The Chinese University of Hong Kong was on taste and emotions. This topic is where my mind went when I saw cultural foods on sticky notes in the class mind map so this article confirmed and informed me more about which emotions people associate to which tastes. The characters used during the first part of the research is a unique point and the topic feels extra special to me because it’s part of my culture and also most related to my original idea. The overall conclusion of the paper from the authors is that the research showed strong correlations between the sense of taste and spoken language. My observations is that sweet and sour was on a light and “positive” side while bitter was on the heavier and “negative” side.

            This article by the Cornell Social Media Lab summarized a research of ShareSoMe that looked at people’s behavior when sharing emotions on Facebook. This article can help me understand how to make the safe feel more comfortable for people to share their emotions since it would be displayed to a lot of people. The result that interested me was that people tend to share less negative things when they know that there is a wider audience and that satisfaction of the person posting increases through interaction. My observation from their results is that people are careful in sharing their personal feelings because they feel that it is too personal to share with people they don’t know but may be more willing to if they received more interaction/attention as a result of sharing.

            The chapter, Emotions and Interpersonal Communication, from Communications in the Real World discussing emotions. I think it gave me interesting views on emotions and helped me define the word a little better. There is a cultural section of the chapter that mentioned how emotions were expressed in different countries and I thought that was interesting to note that although emotions are unique to each person, culture could also play a part in making emotions different for everyone. “Emotional intelligence helps us manage our own emotions and effectively respond to the emotions of others.” is the key takeaway that I feel will help me further my development in this project. I think looking more into emotional intelligence would benefit my project to possibly incorporate an educational aspect to prepare any user for reading the collective emotions of others.
