    <h1>Feasibility Report</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>Features I plan to include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Overlays</li>
            <li>Scrolling gallery</li>
            <li>User input form</li>
            <li>Filter system</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The technologies required to build each feature:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML, CSS for website base code and styling, including overlays and scrolling gallery</li>
            <li>Illustrator for graphic elements that I may need for styling</li>
            <li>Back4App to store data from input forms</li>
            <li>Vanilla JS to query from Back4App</li>
            <li>Possibly a animation/hover library to make the gallery notes interactive</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I am comfortable with HTML and CSS to create the visual look based on mockups and I can make graphics with Illustrator. I think I have enough beginner experience from previous class exercise with Back4App to explore how my HTML input form responses can be stored and queried by Javascript to display in the gallery. With the database, I hope to use it to help me filter responses based on the flavor category that the user chose to input. If I have time, I will probably play with animation/hover libraries that I can find to add interactive elements to my page but my priority is to focus on getting the database to work and creating the filter system.
